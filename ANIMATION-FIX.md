# URGENT ANIMATION FIX SUMMARY

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED
- Framer Motion animations starting with `opacity:0` causing invisible content
- Elements stuck in "hidden" state instead of transitioning to "visible"

## ROOT CAUSE
- Animation `useInView` hooks not triggering properly
- Server-side rendering vs client-side hydration mismatch

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
1. Modified HeroSection: Changed from motion elements to regular divs
2. Modified Header: Removed motion wrapper and animation props
3. Removed all `opacity: 0` initial states that cause invisible content

## RESULT
- All content now visible immediately
- No more hidden elements with opacity:0
- Tailwind CSS working perfectly
- Glass morphism styles applying correctly

## STATUS: CONTENT NOW VISIBLE AND FUNCTIONAL

The invisible content issue has been resolved by removing the problematic Framer Motion animations that were causing elements to remain hidden.
