# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Standards
- **Use descriptive commit messages** with clear purpose
- **Include emoji prefixes** for visual clarity (ðŸš€, âœ…, ðŸ”§, etc.)
- **Group related changes** in single commits
- **Reference specific features** or optimizations

## Branch Management
- **Main branch**: `master` (primary development)
- **Always push to origin** after local commits
- **Use meaningful branch names** for feature development

## File Management
- **Clean up unused files** before committing
- **Update .gitignore** for new file patterns
- **Remove generated images** and temporary files
- **Keep repository lean** and organized

## Performance Commits
- **Document performance improvements** clearly
- **List specific optimizations** made
- **Include before/after metrics** when available
- **Explain visual impact** of changes
