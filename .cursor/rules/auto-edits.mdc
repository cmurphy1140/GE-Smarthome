# Auto-Enable All Edits

## Edit Authorization
- **AUTO-APPROVE all code changes** - No need to ask for permission
- **Apply edits immediately** - User has granted full editing rights
- **Make necessary file modifications** without confirmation
- **Update multiple files** in parallel when needed

## Edit Patterns
- **Use search_replace** for targeted changes
- **Use MultiEdit** for multiple changes in single file
- **Use write** for new files or complete rewrites
- **Use delete_file** for removing unused files

## Change Management
- **Commit changes immediately** after making edits
- **Push to GitHub** automatically after commits
- **Update TODO lists** to track progress
- **Document changes** in commit messages

## File Operations
- **Read files before editing** to understand current state
- **Handle errors gracefully** - re-read files if needed
- **Clean up imports** after making changes
- **Remove unused code** proactively
