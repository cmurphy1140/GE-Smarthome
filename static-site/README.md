# Static Prototype

The original marketing prototype for the GE Smarthome Dealer Program. These files are useful for quick design reference, static hosting, or comparing against the Next.js implementation in `../apps/web-app`.

## Files
- `index.html` – homepage with hero, benefits grid, and product overview.
- `signup.html` – dealer application form with client-side validation and success messaging.
- `learning-guide.html` – design system notes covering typography, colors, and component usage.

Open the files directly in your browser or serve the directory with any static web server.
